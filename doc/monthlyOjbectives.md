# Monthly objectives reports
## Numbers presented

Here is an example of what the script will output:

```sg1: MTD delta: -11.8; T: 2.4/6.0; End: 16:36```

For each project, the numbers presented are

1. The delta between hours worked this month and expected this month at end of day
** Positive means ahead 
** Negative means you are behind (if it was the end of day)
2. The hours worked today on that project
3. The number of hours needed to work today to catch up (if spreading the detla among the remaining buisness day, including today)
4. The estimated time the number of hours will be done, based on no breaks and time of last entry

## Deltas: postive, negative?
* For a delta >0: the redmine user is ahead of hours expected; 
* For a delta <0: the redmine user needs do this many hours today to keep end of month estimates on expected target
